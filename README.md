# Google Meet autojoiner using Classroom
This firefox extension will listen for new comments in Google Classroom comments section.
When teacher posts a comment with Google Meet conference link, this extension will open it to a new tab and join to it, while you're sleeping. Then when you wake up, you can easily take controls to yourself.

## How to install
Check the releases, you'll find a ZIP file. Download it and navigate to about:debugging in firefox. 
There's two tabs on left upper corner. Click "This firefox" and open "Temporary Extensions" dropdown. Click on "Add temporary Add-On" and select the ZIP file you downloaded. Done, now it's working. 

## How to use it
Before you go sleeping, open the classroom assignment/work fully, so the comments are visible. Then you leave it there. When someone posts a google meet link, extension opens it and joins into it. (Remember to mute your microphone so if someone wants to prank you, you won't hear anything from meet.)

## Isn't this illegal?
